## My process
First, I modified the index.html file and gave the text inside it the structure of a card. Then, I styled the card in CSS by using Sass and looking at the designs provided by Frontend Mentor in the design folder.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Preprocessor for CSS

### What I learned

I learned to use filters on images; and about the row-reverse and column-reverse properties of Flexbox.

### Continued development

I want to learn how to properly build a layout using Grid in the next challenges.
